# Readme

The Nacho language is a variation of the R markdown language, especially designed to make it easier to organize your notes into headings and find information quickly. It allows you to have:

* subheadings (##, ###, ####, etc.) that show up in the symbols quick panel even when they are indented.

* highlights within comments using 3 different syntaxes (Ex: `# comment *highlight 1*, :highlight 2:, `highlight 3``)
